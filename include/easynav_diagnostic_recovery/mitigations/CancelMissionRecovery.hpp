/**
 * @class CancelMissionRecovery
 * @brief Level-1 mission-level last resort: cancels the active mission, reporting the error.
 *
 * The final rung of the escalation ladder: accepts any ERROR diagnostic no other mitigation
 * resolved. Meant to be configured with the highest priority number of all (tried last).
 *
 * Unlike other mitigations, this one does not move the robot — it has no reference to
 * GoalManager (only SystemNode does), so it asks for the mission to be cancelled via a one-shot
 * NavState signal ("mission_cancel_requested") that DiagnosticRecoveryManager reads, resets, and
 * turns into SystemActions::abort_mission(). requires_control() is false: it only signals and waits, accepting one non-RT-cycle of
 * latency.
 *
 * on_cycle() reports FAILED once the signal is consumed, not SUCCEEDED: cancelling the mission
 * does not resolve the diagnostic that triggered it (e.g. an AMCL divergence stays a
 * divergence), so claiming success would make it immediately eligible for reselection and
 * re-cancel/re-log forever.
