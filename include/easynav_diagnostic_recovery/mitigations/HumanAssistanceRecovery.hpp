/**
 * @class HumanAssistanceRecovery
 * @brief Level-1 last-resort mitigation: asks a human operator for help.
 *
 * Deliberately simplified: no `teleop` mode, no episode-id `ack` — the "ack" here is physical,
 * whatever fixed the problem shows up as the offending diagnostic going back to OK. Generic and
 * domain-agnostic: unlike SafeRetreatRecovery/AmclRelocalizeMitigation, it does not know or care
 * which component raised the diagnostic — can_handle() accepts any ERROR, meant to be configured
 * with the lowest priority (or listed last in "mitigation_types") so it is only reached once
 * every more specific mitigator has been tried and excluded.
 *
 * Once every diagnostic is observed back at OK — presumably because a human fixed whatever was
 * wrong — it returns control and the robot resumes its current mission; it never fails the
 * mission itself (that is a different mitigation's job).
 *
 * Optionally bounded by "timeout" (seconds, default 0.0 = wait forever): if a human has not
 * fixed things within that time, this mitigation gives up (FAILED) instead of waiting
 * indefinitely, so a lower-priority candidate — e.g. a mission-level "give up" mitigation — can
 * take over.
 *
 * "ignored_hardware_ids" (default {"ros_graph"}) lists diagnostics this mitigation never takes:
 * problems no human can fix by clearing the robot's surroundings (e.g. a miswired ROS graph), so
 * they fall straight through to the mission-level mitigation.
