/**
 * @class ObstacleTooCloseEvaluator
 * @brief Level-1 recovery evaluator: diagnoses "stopped too close to an obstacle".
 *
 * Deliberately a *compound* condition, not just "is something close": it requires the robot to
 * already be (near) stationary before reporting ERROR. The RT-level CollisionSafetyReflex reacts
 * first and stops the robot; this evaluator must not fire while that stop is still happening
 * (still decelerating), or a movement mitigation like SafeRetreatRecovery could take over
 * mid-brake and substitute an unsafe motion for a controlled one. Rather than coupling to the
 * reflex's internal state, "already stopped" is checked against an independent, physically
 * measured signal (the robot's own velocity from "robot_pose"), so this works regardless of
 * *why* the robot stopped.
 *
 * "Stopped" must also be *sustained* for a short debounce window before it is trusted: the RT
 * and non-RT cycles run in parallel, so a single low-velocity sample could still be taken
 * mid-brake. Within that window this evaluator reports OK, not yet the real proximity check.
