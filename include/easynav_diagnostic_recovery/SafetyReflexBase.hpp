/**
 * @class SafetyReflexBase
 * @brief Base class for level-0 (real-time) safety reflexes.
 *
 * A reflex is checked by RecoveryManagerNode on every RT cycle, right before the velocity
 * command is published, against the command about to be sent (commanded_velocity()), whether it
 * comes from the nominal controller or from a movement recovery mitigation: this is what lets a
 * single, small, independently verifiable component gate every current and future source of
 * velocity. Its intervention (override_velocity()/stop_robot()) has the highest priority and is
 * published as is, without smoothing. Unlike other MethodBase-derived plugins, a reflex is not
 * rate-limited by MethodBase::isTime2RunRT() — the RT loop already controls the overall rate —
 * and its own failure is treated as unsafe: if check() or mitigate() throws, the
 * robot is stopped as a fail-safe default instead of assuming the reflex is inactive.
 *
 * A reflex also reports its own severity level (OK/WARN/ERROR) under "diagnostics.<plugin_name>"
 * in the shared "diagnostics" group of NavState, so a future evaluator can notice a reflex
 * triggering repeatedly and escalate to a deliberative mitigation. To keep this cheap on the RT
 * path, it is only written when the severity level actually changes, not on every cycle.
