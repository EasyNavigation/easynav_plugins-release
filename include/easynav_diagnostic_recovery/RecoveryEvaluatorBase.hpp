 * @class RecoveryEvaluatorBase
 * @brief Base class for level-1 (deliberative, non-RT) diagnosis plugins.
 *
 * An evaluator only reads NavState — it never writes "cmd_vel" or otherwise acts on the robot;
 * deciding and acting on a diagnosis is the responsibility of RecoveryMitigationBase plugins and
 * RecoveryManagerNode, not the evaluator itself. Loaded and run by RecoveryManagerNode on its
 * non-RT cycle.
 *
 * Every call to update() is expected to call publish_diagnostic() with the evaluator's
 * *current* assessment, including a benign one (e.g. diagnostic_msgs::msg::DiagnosticStatus::OK)
 * once whatever it was reporting has been resolved. Diagnostics are not accumulated: publishing
 * again under the same plugin name overwrites the previous entry, so a resolved condition does
 * not linger forever in the shared "diagnostics" group.
