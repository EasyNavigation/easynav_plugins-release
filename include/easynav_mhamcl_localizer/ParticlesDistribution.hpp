/**
 * @brief A set of particles representing one hypothesis about the robot pose.
 *
 * Each hypothesis is an independent particle filter (prediction, correction and reseed),
 * as described in "Portable Multi-Hypothesis Monte Carlo Localization for Mobile Robots".
 * Besides the weight of each particle, every hypothesis has a *quality* in [0, 1]: the best fraction of the last perception that
 * matches an obstacle of the map, from any of its particles. Unlike the covariance, it
 * tells how well the hypothesis explains what the robot sees.
 *
 * This class does not depend on ROS nodes, so it can be used and tested standalone.
