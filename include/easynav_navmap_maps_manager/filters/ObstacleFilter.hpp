 * @class ObstacleFilter
 * @brief Marks as obstacles the NavCels under the points that rise above the NavMap surface.
 *
 * Points within max_range of the robot and below max_height (robot frame) are grouped in
 * 0.3 m columns; a column is an obstacle when its highest point is more than min_height (plus
 * min_height_per_meter for each meter from the robot) above the NavMap surface under it. So a 2D
 * laser sees obstacles too, and the ground or a ramp, being on the surface, is not one.
