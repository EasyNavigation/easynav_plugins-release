 * @class AmclRelocalizeMitigation
 * @brief Level-1 movement mitigation: rotates in place to help AMCL relocalize.
 *
 * Selected for diagnostics with hardware_id == "localizer.amcl" (shared with
 * AmclConvergenceEvaluator, in the same package). Takes control of "cmd_vel"
 * (requires_control() == true) and rotates slowly in place each RT cycle, re-checking the same
 * covariance trace the evaluator reads, until it drops back under threshold — or until `timeout`
 * elapses without that happening, at which point it gives up (stops, returns FAILED) rather than
 * spinning forever.
