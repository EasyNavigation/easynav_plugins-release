# easynav_mhamcl_localizer

## Description

Multi-Hypothesis AMCL (MH-AMCL) localizer over a `Costmap2D` map. It is the EasyNav port of
[mh_amcl](https://github.com/fmrico/mh_amcl), described in *Portable Multi-Hypothesis Monte Carlo
Localization for Mobile Robots* (A. García, F. Martín, J. M. Guerrero, F. J. Rodríguez and V. Matellán,
ICRA 2023).

Instead of a single particle filter, it keeps a set of them (*hypotheses*) about the pose of the
robot:

- **Start:** the first hypothesis starts at `initial_pose` (or the pose sent to `initialpose`).
- **Creation:** every `1 / hypotheses_freq` seconds, a *cascade map matching* looks in the **whole**
  map for the poses from which the last perception could have been obtained. The map is stored in a
  pyramid of resolutions (each level halves the previous one). The coarsest level is scanned entirely
  with a fixed angular step, and only the promising cells are refined in the finer levels. A new
  hypothesis starts at every candidate that is far enough from the existing hypotheses.
- **Destruction:** a hypothesis is removed if it is out of the free space of the map or its quality
  is too low.
- **Merge:** hypotheses that converge to the same pose are merged.
- **Output:** the pose (and covariance) of the hypothesis with the best *quality*. Another
  hypothesis takes over only if it is clearly better than the current one.

The *quality* of a hypothesis is the best fraction of the last perception that falls on an obstacle
of the map from any of its particles. It describes how well a hypothesis explains what the robot
sees much better than the covariance does.

This allows to localize the robot **without knowing where it is** and to **recover from kidnapping
or wrong estimates**.

Every hypothesis is a regular particle filter with the phases run independently:

| Phase | Where | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Prediction | `update_rt` | `rt_freq` |
| Correction | `update` | `freq` |
| Reseed | `update` | `reseed_freq` |
| Hypotheses management / map matching | `update` (matching runs in a background thread) | `hypotheses_freq` |

Reseed also adapts the number of particles of each hypothesis in `[min_particles, max_particles]`:
it grows when the quality is low and shrinks when it is high.

### Differences with the Nav2 version

- The observation are the fused `PointPerception`s of NavState (like the other EasyNav localizers)
  instead of a `LaserScan`. Every point is seen along the ray from the robot to it.
- The map is the `map.base` `Costmap2D` of NavState, not an `OccupancyGrid` topic.
- The odometry is not read from its own subscription: it is the odometry perception of `easynav_sensors` (`OdometryPerceptionHandler`), falling back to `odom -> base_footprint` in the `RTTFBuffer`. TF and the initial pose are handled like `easynav_costmap_localizer`.
- The map matching refines the candidates down to the original resolution and runs in a background
  thread. The candidates are moved with the odometry received meanwhile.
- Fixes with respect to the original implementation: parents in reseed are really selected among
  the winners, reseed noise is a standard deviation and not a variance, hypotheses are removed and
  merged safely, and new hypotheses start with the quality of their candidate.

## Plugin (pluginlib)

- **Plugin Name:** `easynav_mhamcl_localizer/MHAMCLLocalizer`
- **Type:** `easynav::mhamcl::MHAMCLLocalizer`
- **Base Class:** `easynav::LocalizerMethodBase`
- **Library:** `easynav_mhamcl_localizer`
- **Description:** Multi-Hypothesis AMCL localizer over a `Costmap2D` map.

See [config/example_params.yaml](config/example_params.yaml). To feed the odometry as a perception, add a sensor to `sensors_node`:

```yaml
sensors_node:
  ros__parameters:
    sensors: [laser1, odom]
    odom:
      topic: odom
      type: nav_msgs/msg/Odometry
```

Note: the map matching cost grows with the size of the map and `1 / matcher_angle_step`. It runs in a
background thread, but on very large maps consider lowering `hypotheses_freq` or increasing the step.
