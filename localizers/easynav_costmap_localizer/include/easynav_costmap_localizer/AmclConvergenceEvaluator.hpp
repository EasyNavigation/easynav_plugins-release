 * @class AmclConvergenceEvaluator
 * @brief Level-1 recovery evaluator: diagnoses AMCL particle-filter divergence.
 *
 * Lives in the same package as AMCLLocalizer instead of the generic recovery_evaluators
 * catalog: only the author of the localizer plugin really knows that particle dispersion (here,
 * the trace of the pose covariance AMCLLocalizer already computes) is a good indicator of lost
 * convergence.
 *
 * Reads the fixed key "localizer.amcl.covariance_trace" (written by AMCLLocalizer from both
 * its RT and non-RT cycles) and publishes `hardware_id = "localizer.amcl"`, matched by
 * AmclRelocalizeMitigation in this same package/manifest — no compile-time dependency between
 * the two, only this agreed-upon diagnostic vocabulary.
