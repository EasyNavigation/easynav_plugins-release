# easynav_navmap_maps_manager

## Description

Maps Manager that maintains a [NavMap](https://github.com/EasyNavigation/NavMap) (triangulated 3D surface) and publishes full maps and layer updates; supports importing from YAML OccupancyGrid or point clouds.

This package also includes map filters implemented as plugins (`ObstacleFilter` and `InflationFilter`) that operate on NavMap layers to detect obstacles and inflate their costs, enabling cost-aware path planning.

## Plugin (pluginlib)

- **Plugin Name:** `easynav_navmap_maps_manager/NavMapMapsManager`
- **Type:** `easynav::navmap::NavMapMapsManager`
- **Base Class:** `easynav::MapsManagerBase`
- **Library:** `easynav_navmap_maps_manager`
- **Description:**  
  Maps Manager that maintains a NavMap (triangulated 3D surface) and publishes full maps and layer updates; supports importing from YAML OccupancyGrid or point clouds, and applying dynamic filters to generate obstacle and inflated layers.

## Parameters

All parameters are declared under the plugin namespace, i.e.  
`/<node_fqn>/easynav_navmap_maps_manager/NavMapMapsManager/...`

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `<plugin>.package` | `string` | `""` | Package name to resolve relative paths via `ament_index`. |
| `<plugin>.freq` | `double` | `10.0` | Update frequency (Hz) for map publishing and filter execution. |
| `<plugin>.navmap_path_file` | `string` | `""` | Relative path (inside the package) to a `.navmap` file to load at startup. |
| `<plugin>.occmap_path_file` | `string` | `""` | Relative path (inside the package) to a ROS YAML OccupancyGrid to import as NavMap. |
| `<plugin>.pcd_path_file` | `string` | `""` | Relative path (inside the package) to a point cloud (PCD/PLY) used to build a NavMap surface. |
| `<plugin>.filters` | `list<string>` | `[]` | Ordered list of filter plugin names to be applied after map loading (e.g. `["obstacles", "inflation"]`). |

### Filter Plugins

#### **ObstacleFilter**

- **Plugin Name:** `easynav_navmap_maps_manager/NavMapMapsManager/ObstacleFilter`
- **Type:** `easynav::navmap::ObstacleFilter`
- **Description:**  
  Detects occupied NavCels from the point perceptions in `NavState` and marks them as `LETHAL_OBSTACLE` in the `"obstacles"` layer, on top of the static map's `"occupancy"` layer (if any).  
  The points are downsampled, those within `max_range` and below `max_height` (robot frame) are grouped in 0.3 m columns, and a column is an obstacle when its highest point is more than `min_height` (plus `min_height_per_meter` for each meter from the robot) above the NavMap surface under it (along the surface's normal). So a 2D laser detects obstacles too, and the ground or a ramp, being on the surface, is not one.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `<plugin>.max_range` | `double` | `10.0` | Only points within this distance (x and y, robot frame) are used. |
| `<plugin>.min_height` | `double` | `0.1` | Height above the NavMap surface below which points are the ground. |
| `<plugin>.min_height_per_meter` | `double` | `0.0` | `min_height` grows this much per meter of horizontal distance from the robot (`< 0` or not finite: `0`). On rough terrain, a small error in the robot's tilt lifts the ground more the farther it is; e.g. `0.05` adds 0.25 m at 5 m. |
| `<plugin>.max_height` | `double` | `NaN` | Points above this height (robot frame) are ignored; `NaN` disables it. |
| `<plugin>.downsample_resolution` | `double` | `0.3` | Voxel size (m) the points are reduced to first; `<= 0` disables it. |
| **Input Key:** | | | Reads list of point clouds from `NavState` group `"points"`. |
| **Output Layer:** | | | Updates or creates NavMap layer `"obstacles"`. |

#### **InflationFilter**

- **Plugin Name:** `easynav_navmap_maps_manager/NavMapMapsManager/InflationFilter`
- **Type:** `easynav::navmap::InflationFilter`
- **Description:**  
  Expands obstacle information from the `"obstacles"` layer into an `"inflated_obstacles"` layer, assigning graded costs depending on distance to obstacles and map boundaries (NavCels with missing neighbors).  
  This filter mimics the behavior of `costmap_2d::InflationLayer` but operates on the NavMap triangular mesh.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `<plugin>.inflation_radius` | `double` | `0.3` | Maximum inflation distance (m) from obstacles. |
| `<plugin>.cost_scaling_factor` | `double` | `3.0` | Exponential decay rate controlling how fast cost decreases with distance. |
| `<plugin>.inscribed_radius` | `double` | — | **Deprecated**: the robot's `system_node.robot_geometry.inscribed_radius`, used unless only this one is configured (with a warning). Radius of inscribed zone (constant high cost before decay). |
| **Input Layer:** | | | Reads from `"obstacles"`. |
| **Output Layer:** | | | Writes to `"inflated_obstacles"`. |
