/**
 * @class AdvanceRecovery
 * @brief Level-1 movement mitigation: advances a short distance when the robot is stuck.
 *
 * Selected for diagnostics with hardware_id == "controller_stuck". Takes control of "cmd_vel"
 * (requires_control() == true) and commands a slow, straight-forward motion — same single gate
 * as any other producer of "cmd_vel" (CollisionSafetyReflex), so "only if there is no obstacle"
 * is enforced by the level-0 reflex, not duplicated here.
 *
 * Deliberately never reports SUCCEEDED as "the stuck condition is fixed": completing one
 * advance only means this activation is done, not that the underlying cause is gone. If it
 * recurs, ControllerStuckEvaluator will simply diagnose it again and this mitigation activates
 * again — by design, "advances a bit" repeatedly for as long as the problem keeps reappearing.
 * It only gives up (FAILED, so RecoveryManagerNode escalates to the next candidate) once the
 * *total* time spent on this recurring episode — summed across every activation — exceeds
 * "escalate_after". A long enough gap between activations resets that clock: see on_start().
