/**
 * @class SafeRetreatRecovery
 * @brief Level-1 movement mitigation: moves straight away from a too-close obstacle.
 *
 * Selected for diagnostics with hardware_id == "obstacle_proximity" (shared with
 * ObstacleTooCloseEvaluator, matched by string). Takes control of "cmd_vel"
 * (requires_control() == true) and commands a slow, straight motion each RT cycle, re-checking
 * the nearest-obstacle distance until it exceeds safe_distance.
 *
 * The direction, chosen on the first cycle and kept: backward if the nearest obstacle is ahead,
 * forward if it is behind or beside (a differential-drive robot cannot strafe; moving along its
 * axis also moves it away from an obstacle beside it). If that way is not clear
 * ("min_clearance" along the robot's corridor) and the obstacle is roughly beside (60-120 deg),
 * the other way is tried. It fails, stopped, when no way is clear, when the way gets blocked
 * while moving, or without perception.
