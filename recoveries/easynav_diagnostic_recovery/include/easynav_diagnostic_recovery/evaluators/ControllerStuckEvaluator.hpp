/**
 * @class ControllerStuckEvaluator
 * @brief Level-1 recovery evaluator: diagnoses "commanded to move, but not making progress".
 *
 * Compares "robot_pose" across a debounce window while "cmd_vel" commands non-trivial motion;
 * if the robot barely moves for long enough, reports ERROR with hardware_id "controller_stuck".
 *
 * Four preconditions must hold before this evaluator judges anything, each skipping to OK
 * otherwise:
 * - Navigation must not be paused: the controller plugin keeps writing a non-trivial "cmd_vel"
 *   into NavState while paused, oblivious to it (only the value actually published to the robot
 *   is zeroed, elsewhere). Unlike the other preconditions, this one re-arms
 *   reference_position_/reference_time_ every cycle instead of freezing them, since the robot
 *   genuinely does not move while paused and a frozen reference would fire a false ERROR the
 *   instant navigation resumes. The same during a protective stop of the safety channel.
 * - "control_owner" must be "controller": an evaluator that watches cmd_vel/the controller must
 *   not evaluate while a recovery mitigation owns control, or it would self-diagnose the very
 *   recovery it is part of as a new failure. This one freezes its progress-tracking state
 *   instead (see the .cpp for why the two preconditions need different treatment).
 * - No SafetyReflexBase-derived reflex may currently be intervening — if the robot isn't moving
 *   because the level-0 reflex is holding it back from a real obstacle, that is not "stuck".
 * - There must be an active goal ("goals" non-empty) — without one, nothing was expected to
 *   make progress in the first place.
